  "Sentence1": "This application is a viewer of the data collected by ICATMAR to carry out scientific monitoring of fisheries, transfer the knowledge acquired and facilitate the management of fishing on the Catalan coast. The application has been developed by the Catalan Maritime Network (BlueNetCat) in collaboration with ICATMAR. Currently the application only shows the bottom trawling data.",
  "Sentence2": "ICATMAR (Catalan Research Institute for the Governance of the Sea) is a cooperation body between the General Directorate of Maritime Policy and Sustainable Fisheries (Generalitat de Catalunya) and the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) with management autonomy, which arises from the need for scientific advice to develop the program of the Maritime Strategy of Catalonia.",
  "Sentence3": "A team made up of sixteen technicians specialized in marine biological sciences and in computer tools for geolocation and information support, coordinated and advised by researchers from the Department of Renewable Marine Resources of the Institute of Marine Sciences of Barcelona, have been the material authors of the scientific follow-up that has been aimed at maritime fisheries in both their commercial and recreational aspects.",
  "Sentence4": "In October 2018, the monitoring program for the species of greatest fishing interest was launched, where one of the key elements is the collection of data and their structuring so that they can be analyzed and visualized.",
